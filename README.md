## üîß Tech Stack & Architecture

| Layer          | Tools/Frameworks                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication | Clerk (email/password + OAuth)                            |
| Backend        | Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Mongoose (TypeScript)       |
| Frontend       | React + TypeScript + Chart.js/Recharts                    |
| Storage        | MongoDB collections for users, transactions, images       |
| OCR            | Gemini 2.5 flash Multimodal                               |
| Dev Tooling    | ESLint, Prettier, React Hook Form, Zod/Yup for validation |

* **Strict Type Validation** ensures that invalid data whether from frontend forms or backend endpoints is caught before deployment.
* **End-to-end Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types for models like `Transaction`, `User`, etc., minimize runtime issues.

## üì¶ Getting Started

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yash-sojitra/Hisab.git
cd Hisab
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

* **Backend**

  ```bash
  cd server
  npm install
  ```

* **Frontend**

  ```bash
  cd ../client
  npm install
  ```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create `.env` files:

* **backend/.env**

  ```
  MONGO_URI=
  PORT=
  CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
  GEMINI_API_KEY=
  ```

* **frontend/.env**

  ```
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY==<your-clerk-publishable-key>
  ```

### 4. Run Locally

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

By default frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`, talking to backend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üñºÔ∏è Uploading a Receipt

1. Go to **Add Transaction ‚Üí Upload Receipt**
2. Select or take a photo
3. OCR reads items, amounts, and date
4. You review/edit the auto-filled form
5. Save ‚Äî it logs both the image and the parsed data

---

## üß† Why TypeScript?

* **Strong Typing** prevents bugs from mismatched request schemas or corrupted responses.
* **Shared Interfaces** between frontend and backend promote consistency and reduce duplication.
* **IDE Autocomplete & Refactor Safety** make maintenance and scaling a breeze.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Validation Highlights

* **Frontend**: Form validation (with React Hook Form + Zod/Yup) ensures only valid data is submitted.
* **Backend**: API schemas verify received data (e.g. `ADD_TXN` requires `amount: number`, `date: string`, `category: string`, etc.).
* **OCR Parsing**: Parses strings to typed fields; validation ensures quality before saving.

---

## üìù API Endpoints

* **POST** `/api/auth/*` ‚Äî Handled by Clerk
* **GET/POST/PUT/DELETE** `/api/transactions` ‚Äî Authenticated CRUD
* **GET** `/api/transactions?filter=...&page=...` ‚Äî Supports pagination and filtering
* **POST** `/api/transactions/process-image` ‚Äî Receives image, OCRs and returns parsed data
* **GET** `/api/transactions/summary` - Receives summary of user needed for dashboard and graphs
* **GET/POST/PUT** `/api/categories/summary` - Authenticated CRU for categories
* **POST** `/api/user/webhooks` - for sync between clerk and user Database
